# Network Syslog Samples

This repo provides sample syslog messages from various network vendors.

## Purpose

While attempting to build grok commands to parse Syslog for various vendors, I couldn't find anything outside of some tests in various repos ([napalm-logs](https://github.com/napalm-automation/napalm-logs) primarily) that provided sample syslog messages from devices.

This attempts to remediate that problem.
